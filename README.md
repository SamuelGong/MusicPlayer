# 1. OVERVIEW
*MusicPlayer*, as its name reveals, is a gorgeous **wav** music player based on **Qt** libraries and 
equiped with **lyric** and **spectrum** display*.
As a homework assigned in the **object-oriented program design** course for sophomore majoring in CS,
it is a **teamwork project** for **non-comercial** purposes.
This system allows you to play music or songs of wav format in the environment which supports some Qt libraries
(since we only compile it in dynamic way).
If the songs has its lyrics file (*.lrc) in the same folder as it, the lyrics can also be shown simultaneously.  
The overall interface can be refered to the following snapshot.
